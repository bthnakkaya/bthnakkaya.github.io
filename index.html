    <h1>Ibrahim Batuhan AKKAYA</h1>

    I am currently a senior research engineer at ASELSAN and a Ph.D. Candidate at Middle East Technical University (METU).

    My Ph.D. studies involve domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. It aims to train a reliable and accurate semantic segmentation algorithm in the lack of labeled data by using auxiliary data such as synthetic images. Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. in METU where I designed a mouse face tracker algorithm to be used in medical studies.

    In addition to my academic training, I have experience in the defense industry for several years. I have worked in ASELSAN Inc. in different roles, namely hardware design engineer, computer vision engineer, and senior research engineer. As a research engineer, I am responsible for conducting research on state-of-the-art computer vision technologies.
